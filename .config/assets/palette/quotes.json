	"There was no reason for me to stay in the real world any longer.",

	"Why... Why are you so warm? Why do I have to share your body heat?",
	"You forget a thousand things every day. How about you make sure this is one of them?",
	"I just want to be a part of this world.",
	"The world is full of possibilities; don’t be afraid to explore them.",
	"I exist in the network; I am the network.",
	"God is here."
